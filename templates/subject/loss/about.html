  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    Grief is deeply personal and non-linear. While many tools describe stages of grief,
    this program offers something more meaningful: a way to reflect on your <strong>Coping Journey</strong> —
    the path you've taken from the moment of your loss to where you are now.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    At the heart of this journey is a structured model we call the <strong>Adaptation Vector</strong>.
    It helps us measure not just where you are emotionally, but how you’ve moved through time —
    capturing the direction and strength of your adaptation.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    You’ll answer a set of yes/no questions designed to surface patterns in your grief response.
    Your answers create a snapshot of your emotional progression — no judgment, just awareness.
