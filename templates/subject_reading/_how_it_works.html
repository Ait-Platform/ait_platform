  <p>
    The Reading Programme has 20 short lessons. Each lesson is video-based and focused on sounds,
    word building, and oral practice. You can pause, go back, and replay as much as you need.

    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
      <li>Your access window is 5 days. We only start counting the 5 days when you press play on your first lesson — not when you pay.</li>
      <li>You can watch any lesson, in any order, and replay the same lesson many times. We track practice, not speed.</li>
      <li>You’ll see a live tracker: how many of the 20 lessons you’ve started, how many times each lesson was repeated, and how much time you have left in your 5-day window.</li>
      <li>At the end of the window, you’ll get a participation certificate. It shows your name, how much of the programme you covered, and how many times you practised the material.</li>
      <li>If you’re working with more than one learner, or you want a fresh window and a new certificate, you can enrol again.</li>
    </ul>
