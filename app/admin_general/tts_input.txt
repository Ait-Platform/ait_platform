Grief is deeply personal — and never linear.
While many tools describe stages of grief, this experience offers something more meaningful:
a way to reflect on your Coping Journey —
the path you’ve taken from the moment of your loss to where you are now.
At the heart of that journey is a structured model we call the Adaptation Vector.
It helps you see not only where you are emotionally,
but how you’ve moved through time —
capturing the direction and strength of your adaptation.
